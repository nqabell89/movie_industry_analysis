## Assumptions:
* Microsoft wants to create a movie in the US for primarily domestic audience, while maximizing worldwide audience as a secondary goal
* Movies made prior to 1960 are likely irrelevant in this analysis, due to dramatically changed film industry, budgets, genre preferences, etc
* Critic scores have long been irrelevant as it purtains to the financial success and/or audience scores of a film.
